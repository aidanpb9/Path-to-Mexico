# Code Breakdown

main.py: This file handles the game's flow by setting up the story to track events. It allows players to either load a saved game or start a new one, then enters a loop where they can explore rooms, interact with objects, and make choices. Players can save their progress at any time, and the game continues until a specific story goal is completed.

Modules_Rooms.py: This file contains the primary structure for the gameâ€™s rooms, where the player navigates. It also contains functions for each room's unique functionalities. It defines each room with attributes like name, interactable objects, and exits. It also tracks event occurrence within a room, which influences future interactions and story progression. The player can interact with objects in the room, move between rooms, and trigger story events.

Modules_Story.py: This file contains functions that print important narration sections in the game. It defines static functions that are called in Main or Modules_Rooms that give the player new story based information.

utils.py: This file contains helper functions with various functionalities which includes text rendering, save/load game, error checking, and randomly generating certain game features.

# Creator's thoughts

This game is part 1 of the story, which I may or may not finish. Part 2 would be a game to navigate to the airport; I would want to have a totally different type of gameplay to practice new skills for this part like driving a car around the city. Part 3 would be navigating to the resort in Mexico; I have not decided what unique gameplay mechanic I could use for this. 

I created this game as a project mainly to familiarize myself with Python. The next steps for the current game (part 1) is to host the game on a website; I would use Django for this. Then I can add a GUI to make it feel like a proper game. This would be great front-end practice.

# Hints

The ">" expects you to press enter.

For other inputs, type a number like '1', or a character like 'y', then press enter to choose that option.

You can only navigate to a room that you are currently next to.

To complete the game, you need to pack the suitcase, obtain the car keys, and buy a plane ticket. When you have done all of these, you should prepare the car in the garage. Keep exploring the house to complete the necessary tasks. There are certain things that need to be discovered or unlocked.

If you see "all flights are too expensive", keep trying, as a new flight is randomly generated each time you access the pc. Eventually, you should find a ticket that is affordable.
